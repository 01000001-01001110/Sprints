# Sprint Notes are currently the most updated, with regex formatting, WPF, and correctly remove weekend dates from any length sprint.

I have added the following variables to the sprint_Notes.ps1 to make it easier to format to your liking.

<pre>
$MainFG = "Azure"
$MainBG = "Transparent"
$ButtonBG = "Navy"
$ButtonFG = "Azure"
$BackBG = "CornflowerBlue"
$BorderBG = "Navy"
$BarBG = "Navy"
$FontFamily = "Century Gothic"
$TextBoxBG = "Transparent"
$MainFontSZ = "14"
$ToolBG = "Transparent"
$MainWindowHeight = "265"
$MainWindowWidth = "254"
</pre>
